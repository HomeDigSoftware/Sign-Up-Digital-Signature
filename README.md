1	Create modern, professional landing page for SignEase
	
	Design and implement a clean, professional landing page for SignEase using React
	and Tailwind CSS. The page should clearly communicate the value proposition of 
	the digital signature system for real estate and sales professionals. Include 
	sections for features, benefits, and a call-to-action button for sign-up/log-in.
	The design should follow the light theme with professional minimalism approach.
	
====================================================================================================
1. Install and configure Firebase extension for authentication

	Install the Firebase extension in Databutton and configure it for authentication 
	with email and password. Set up the necessary Firebase project, enable Authentication
	service with email/password method, and integrate the configuration with the app. 
	Ensure the login and signup pages are working properly with the Firebase 
	Authentication service.
====================================================================================================

3	Implement document upload functionality with PDF preview

	Create a document upload page that allows users to 
	upload PDF documents and preview them. Implement the UI fo
	r document upload with drag-and-drop and file selection. Set up Firebase
	Storage for storing the uploaded documents. Integrate PDF.js to provide
	a preview of the uploaded document. The document should be displayed clearly 
	with pagination controls.
	
===================================================================================================
	
4   Build signature placement tool with drag-and-drop interface
	
	Develop a signature placement tool that allows users to specify
	where signatures should be placed on a document. Implement drag-and-drop
	functionality to position signature fields on the PDF preview.
	Save the signature field positions in Firestore linked to the document.
	The interface should be intuitive with clear visual indicators for signature fields.
	
===================================================================================================

5  Create signature capture component with drawing capabilities

	Build a signature capture component that allows users to draw 
	their signature using a mouse or touchpad. Implement the SignaturePad 
	library for capturing free-form signatures. Include options to clear and
	redraw the signature. Save the signature image to Firebase Storage and
	link it to the user's profile in Firestore.
	
===================================================================================================
6	Design document list view with status tracking

	Create a dashboard view that displays all documents uploaded by the 
	user with their current status (draft, pending signature, signed). 
	Implement Firestore queries to fetch and display documents with their statuses. 
	Include sorting and filtering options. The document list should update in real-time 
	when document statuses change.

===================================================================================================
7	Implement email invitation system for document signing

	Develop functionality to send email invitations to recipients for signing documents. 
	Create an API endpoint that sends emails using SendGrid or EmailJS. 
	The email should include a unique link that allows the recipient to access and sign 
	the document without registration. Track the status of sent invitations in Firestore.

===================================================================================================
8	Set up email notification system for document status updates

	Create a notification system that sends emails when document statuses change. 
	Implement Firebase Cloud Functions to trigger emails when documents are 
	viewed, signed, or completed. Set up templates for different types of notifications. 
	Configure the system to avoid sending too many notifications to users.
